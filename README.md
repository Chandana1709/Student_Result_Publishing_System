# Student_Result_Publishing_System

The current student result publishing system relies on manual data entry and manipulation,leading to potential errors and delays in result publication. Administrators have to manually
modify the Excel result sheet and convert it into a CSV file before uploading it to the database.The system lacks automation and data validation, making it time-consuming and error-prone
for administrators to manage result data.

The primary function of the Student Result Publishing System is to publish semester-wise academic results to students accurately and promptly. Students can securely log in to the
system and view their subject-wise grades, cumulative GPA, and other academic details.Admins, on the other hand, can manage the system and control the publication of results. They have the privilege to upload result sheets, manage student details, and handle any result-relatedtasks. The system ensures real-time availability of results, enabling students to access their
performance feedback as soon as it is published.

In the admin result system, administrators can effortlessly modify the Excel sheet containing student results without the requirement to convert it into CSV. The system allows direct uploading of Excel files, ensuring a convenient and efficient process for managing academic performance data and can perform analytics.
